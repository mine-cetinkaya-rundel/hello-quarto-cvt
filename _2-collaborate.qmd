**Mine:** Much of my work, and I'm sure much of yours is collaborative.

[Many scientists <br> use Python <br> ðŸ˜¬]{.larger}

::: notes
Many scientists use python and jupyter notebooks. So your collaborations might involve going across languages, but you likely are not looking to learn Python from the ground-up for a collaboration alone. 
Additionally, if you're an R Markdown user, you might already either be running Python code via reticulate to keep your work in R Markdown, or feel like you need to give up on the R Markdown authoring experience in your collaborations across languages. Jupyter notebooks are an obvious place for reproducible authoring, and a place where Python users particularly feel at home. And when you feel "at home" in a computing environment, you rarely want to leave it just for the purpose of collaboration, and instead you just with your collaborator would leave theirs and come to yours.

So, let's take a pulse first.

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding languages. This is a simplified view of the yaml it's collection of different file types. It's mostly ipynbs Jupyter notebooks.

And, as we work with more research teams we've found that there is indeed a substantial R community using NASA Earthdata Cloud data. And we're positioned to support R users too

::: notes
With Quarto, you're able to contribute from whatever tool you're already comfortable with,whether that's the RStudio IDE, JupyterLab, VS Code, or directly editing documents on GitHub.

This is so important because doing science is already challenging and and we don't also need people to shift their software tools to be able to participate in the work.

transtion: Let me show you how to use Quarto with Jupyter with ipynb notebooks.

::: notes
-   Orient to JupyterLab. This is a JupyterHub managed by our collaborators at 2i2c
-   Open Mine's example site, quarto preview
- add .ipynb 
-   Add `.ipynb` to `_quarto.yml`
-   View website - new page is added to website
-  Add fig captions
- margin plots: a style preferred by many now in jupyter notebook

Native multi-language support has implications for teaching as well. So I'll now shift gears to talk a bit about teaching next.
