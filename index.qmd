Thank you so much, we're excited to be here!
I have been using, teaching, and contributing to the development of Quarto over the last year.
As I've woven it into my work I realized that I love it, and I'm very thrilled to talk to you about it today.

You might be wondering -- What is Quarto?
Why is Quarto?
And how does it relate to R Markdown and the workflows you already have?

--\> Well

::: notes
It unifies it for people who love R Markdown by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it for people who don't know RMarkdown by being a friendly way to work reproducibly and publish documents that have text and code in the same place

I'm going to introduce Quarto in four acts -- Share, Collaborate, Teach, and Reimagine.
Each with a story and a demo.
So, let's get started.

::: notes
Thank you so much for joining this morning.
This was an introduction to Quarto from the perspective of sharing, collaborating, teaching, and reimagining.
I've only managed to scratch the surface of Quarto's features so I invite you to dig deeper into the documentation and tutorials and play with it yourself.
The slides for the talk are at the link above.
And if you go there and proceed to the next slide you'll find many useful resources, including the source code for the site we built in the demos.
While Quarto is stable and ready for use, it's also a baby that you too can be a part of its growth.
So start using Quarto, and get involved by asking questions, reporting issues, providing feedback, and even building extensions for it.
We can't wait to see what you create!
